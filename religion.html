                <p> This entry discusses the history of modern Turkey from its formation in the aftermath of the Ottoman
                    defeat in World War I (1914–18) until the 21st century. For discussion of earlier history of the
                    area, see Anatolia; Ottoman Empire.

        <p> Meanwhile, Turkey’s strong secularism has resulted in what have been perceived by some as strictures on the
            freedom of religion. For example, the head scarf has long been prohibited in a number of public venues. Such
            restrictions on religious freedom have been confronted in the 21st century by the rise of the Justice and
            Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi; AKP); a constitutional amendment was passed in February 2008
            that permitted women to wear head scarves on university campuses. </p>
        <p> In addition to the Muslim majority, there also exist small populations of Jews and Christians; Christian
            adherents are divided between Greek Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Protestant, and other
            denominations. </p>
