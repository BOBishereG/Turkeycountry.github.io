                <p> Football (soccer) is a favourite sport in Turkey; introduced to the region in the late 19th century,
                    the game was repressed by Ottoman officials, who believed that it was connected to rebellious
                    activities. In 1923 a national federation was formed, and it became affiliated with the Fédération
                    Internationale de Football Association later that year; in 1954 the country appeared in its first
                    World Cup. Wrestling is another favoured sport. Numerous athletes still compete in oiled wrestling—a
                    sport practiced in the region for some six centuries—in annual competitions.

        <p> Turkey made its first Olympic appearance at the 1908 games in London, where it was represented by gymnast
            Aleko Mulas. However, most of the country’s medals have been for wrestling, although it has also had success
            in boxing and track and field. </p>

            <p>>One of Turkey’s most famous Olympians is Naim Süleymanoğlu (known as Pocket
            Hercules), a Bulgarian-born featherweight weightlifter who defected to Turkey while a teenager. Süleymanoğlu
            set numerous world records in the late 1980s and ’90s and won a number of Olympic gold medals.</p>
