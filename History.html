                <p> Since its inception in 1923, Turkey has operated a mixed economy, in which both state and private
                    enterprise contribute to economic development. The economy has been transformed from predominantly
                    agricultural to one in which industry and services are the most productive and rapidly expanding
                    sectors. A decade into the 21st century, the services sector engaged about one-half of the
                    workforce, while agriculture and industry each occupied about one-fourth. </p>

    <div class="Turkey-description">
        <p> The autocratic, dominating, and inspiring personality of Kemal Atatürk (“Father of Turks,” as Mustafa Kemal
            came to be known) had directed and shaped the Turkish republic. At his death in 1938 his closest associate,
            İsmet İnönü, was elected president. With the approach of World War II (1939–45), foreign affairs assumed
            greater importance. An alliance with the Allied powers Britain and France (October 19, 1939) was not
            implemented because of Germany’s early victories. </p>

        <p> After Germany’s invasion of the Soviet Union (June 1941), there was popular support for an alliance with
            Germany, which seemed to offer prospects of realizing old Pan-Turkish aims. Although a nonaggression pact
            was signed with Germany (June 18, 1941), Turkey clung to neutrality until the defeat of the Axis powers
            became inevitable; it entered the war on the Allied side on February 23, 1945, mere weeks before the war’s
            end. The great expansion of Soviet power in the postwar years exposed Turkey in June 1945 to Soviet demands
            for control over the straits connecting the Black Sea with the Aegean and for the cession of territory in
            eastern Anatolia. It was also suggested that a large area of northeastern Anatolia be ceded to Soviet
            Georgia. This caused Turkey to seek and receive U.S. assistance; U.S. military aid began in 1947 (providing
            the basis for a large and continuing flow of military aid), and economic assistance began in 1948. </p>

        <p> In the more open atmosphere, the DP was able to organize in the villages. The CHP, despite its local village
            institutes, had always been the government party and had little real grassroots organization. The Democrats
            were much more responsive to local interests. The DP won a massive victory in the 1950 elections, claiming
            54 percent of the vote and 396 out of 487 seats. The CHP won 68 seats, the National Party 1. The DP victory
            has been attributed variously to American influence, social change, a desire for economic liberalization,
            better organization, religious hostility to the CHP, and a bad harvest in 1949. Perhaps the ultimate reason,
            however, is simply that in 27 years the CHP had made too many enemies.</p>
