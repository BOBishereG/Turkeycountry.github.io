                <p>Following a period of authoritarian one-party rule under the first president of the republic, Mustafa
                    Kemal (Atatürk; 1923–38), and his successor, İsmet İnönü (1938–50), multiparty democracy was
                    instituted in 1950. Parliamentary democracy has for the most part remained in force since that date,
                    although it has been interrupted by brief periods of military government at times when civilian rule
                    was perceived as ineffective. After each military interlude (1960–61, 1971–73, 1980–83), power was
                    returned to civilian hands under a revised constitution.</p>

        <p> Justice
            Before the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, Turkish civil law was linked to religion and was
            administered by Sharīʿah courts. With the reforms of 1926, a number of new legal codes were established
            based in part on the Swiss Civil and Italian penal codes. Following these changes, the independence of the
            judiciary—including the constitutional court and the courts responsible for criminal, civil, and
            administrative matters—has been ensured by the constitution. A number of superior courts, including a court
            of appeals, also exist to examine these rulings.</p>

        <p> Local government
            Turkey’s provinces are administered by governors, who are appointed by the Council of Ministers, subject to
            the approval of the president. Provinces are divided into districts and subdistricts. Villages are governed
            by a headman and a council of elders, both elected by the village residents.
        </p>

        <p> Political process
            A recurrent theme in Turkish politics is the conflict between progressive and conservative elements, the
            former intent on fully implementing Atatürk’s vision of a wholly secular, Westernized state and the latter
            seeking to preserve the values of traditional Islamic-Turkish culture. The legacy of Atatürk remains central
            to Turkish political life; throughout the first 50 years of the republic, all major political parties
            professed adherence to the doctrines of Kemalism (also called Atatürkism), which defined Turkey as
            nationalist, republican, statist, populist, and revolutionary and emphasized Westernization, the separation
            of religion from politics, and a leading role for the state in economic affairs. With the predominance of
            Kemalism, Atatürk’s own party, the Republican People’s Party (Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi; CHP), remained a
            mainstay throughout the republic’s history.</p>
