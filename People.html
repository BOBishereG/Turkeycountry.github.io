                <p> According to the Turkish constitution, the word “Turk,” as a political term, includes all citizens
                    of the Republic of Turkey, without distinction of or reference to race or religion; ethnic
                    minorities have no official status. Linguistic data show that a majority of the population claim
                    Turkish as their mother tongue; most of the remainder speak Kurdish and a small minority Arabic as
                    their first language.

        <p> Demographic trends
            In 1927 the total population of the Turkish republic was about 13 million; since then it has increased more
            than sixfold. Growth was particularly rapid after World War II, reaching nearly 3 percent annually in the
            early 1960s, but the rate of growth has since declined. A fall in the birth rate was the main factor for the
            decline, offset somewhat by a decline in the death rate.</p>

        <p> Settlement patterns
            About three-fourths of the population lives in towns and cities. Prior to the mid-20th century, however, the
            population was predominantly rural, and its distribution was strongly influenced by the agricultural
            potential of the land. Thus, there are pronounced regional variations in population density, the main
            contrast being between the interior and the periphery. The regional coastlands of the Black Sea, the Sea of
            Marmara, and the Aegean Sea are the most densely settled regions; accounting for less than two-fifths of the
            country’s land area, the regions together represent more than half its population.</p>
