                <p> Turkish is the mother tongue of 90 percent of the population of the country. Some 70 other languages
                    and dialects are also spoken, including various dialects of Caucasian and Kurdish as well as Arabic,
                    Greek, Ladino and Armenian. The Turkish language of Türkiye represents the southwestern arm of the
                    community of Turkic languages within the Ural-Altay linguistic family that slowly evolved over time.
                    Groups speaking these languages spread to the east and northeast out of Central Asia, and
                    particularly to the west. </p>

        <p> Ever since the 8th century, the Turks have employed a number of alphabets, although mainly the Göktürk,
            Uyghur, Arabic and Latin ones. After the foundation of the Republic and the establishment of national unity,
            and particularly between 1923 and 1928, people began to focus on the alphabet problem in Türkiye. </p>
            <p></p>The
            founder of the Republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, believed that it was essential to make use of Western
            culture in order for the country to reach the level of contemporary civilisation, to which end, in 1928, he
            brought about the acceptance of Latin letters, modified to reflect the sounds of the Turkish language, to
            replace the Arabic alphabet. </p>
