                <p> Culturally, as in so many other respects, Turkey sits between East and West, drawing elements from
                    both to produce its own unique blend. The territory that now constitutes the republic has been
                    subject to a striking range of cultural influences; these have left a rich archaeological legacy,
                    still visible in the landscape, from the civilizations of Classical Europe and the Islamic Middle
                    East.

        <p> Daily life
            Work
            In the rural areas each season has different tasks and activities. Except in the south and west, winter is a
            period of frost, snow, and social activities. Animals are often kept indoors and fed mainly chopped straw.
            With the spring thaw, plowing and sowing are soon under way. After a month or so of less-urgent work, the
            hay harvest is followed immediately by the main grain harvest, a period of intense activity lasting some six
            to eight weeks; everyone works, some people 16 to 20 hours a day. Most village areas contain weavers,
            masons, carpenters, and smiths such as tinsmiths. Some villagers go to town for craft services, and a number
            of craftsmen travel around the villagesâ€”particularly specialists, such as sieve makers or sawyers.</p>

        <p> Dress
            Turkish men have increasingly adopted the styles and sombre colours of European male dress. Fezzes and
            turbans were abolished by law in 1925, and most peasants now wear cloth caps. The famous Turkish baggy
            trousers, exceedingly full in the seat, are still quite common in rural areas and among the poorer town
            dwellers, but the traditional cummerbund and colourful shift or waistcoat are rare.</p>

        <p> Arts and media
            During the 20th century, Western forms of art, music, and literature assumed a place in Turkish national
            culture alongside traditional indigenous cultural expressions. While many writers, artists, and musicians
            have abandoned traditional Islamic modes in favour of Western ones, Turkish culture has adopted a strongly
            nationalistic slant evidenced by the use of the vernacular in literature, the depiction of village scenes in
            the visual arts, and the popularity of folk ballads and other traditional forms in music.</p>
