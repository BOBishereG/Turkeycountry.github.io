                <p> Since its inception in 1923, Turkey has operated a mixed economy, in which both state and private
                    enterprise contribute to economic development. The economy has been transformed from predominantly
                    agricultural to one in which industry and services are the most productive and rapidly expanding
                    sectors. A decade into the 21st century, the services sector engaged about one-half of the
                    workforce, while agriculture and industry each occupied about one-fourth. </p>

        <p> Turkey has a great variety of natural resources, though few occur on a large scale. Apart from Iran, Turkey
            is the only Middle Eastern country with significant coal deposits, mainly in the Zonguldak field. Output of
            lignite is substantial. There is small-scale production of oil from fields in the southeast of the country,
            as well as in the northwestern Thrace region; this provides for only a fraction of the country’s needs, and
            Turkey is thus dependent on imported petroleum products. </p>
        <p> Industry
            Turkey supports a wide range of manufacturing activities. Manufacturing plants are widely distributed, with
            clusters of factories in all sizable towns, although a high proportion of total output comes from four
            highly industrialized zones: Istanbul and the area around the Sea of Marmara, the Aegean coast around İzmir,
            the Adana basin, and the region around Ankara. The leading manufactures are chemicals; food, beverages, and
            tobacco; and textiles, clothing, and footwear. </p>

        <p> Transportation
            Since the establishment of the republic, and particularly since World War II, economic development has involved
            large-scale state investment in transportation. Until the 1950s this investment was concentrated on the railway
            network, but in subsequent decades Turkey focused on its system of roads and highways.</p>
