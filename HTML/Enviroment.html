            <div class="Turkey-description">
                <p>Turkey is a predominantly mountainous country, and true lowland is confined to the coastal fringes.
                    About one-fourth of the surface has an elevation above 4,000 feet (1,200 metres), and less than
                    two-fifths lies below 1,500 feet (460 metres). Mountain crests exceed 7,500 feet (2,300 metres) in
                    many places, particularly in the east, where Turkey’s highest mountain, Mount Ararat (Ağrı), reaches
                    16,945 feet (5,165 metres) close to the borders with Armenia and Iran. In the southeast the Uludoruk
                    Peak reaches 15,563 feet (4,744 metres); though further west, the Demirkazık Peak (12,320 feet
                    [3,755 metres]) and Mount Aydos (11,414 feet [3,479 metres]) are also significant peaks. Steep
                    slopes are common throughout the country, and flat or gently sloping land makes up barely one-sixth
                    of the total area. These relief features affect other aspects of the physical environment, producing
                    climates often much harsher than might be expected for a country of Turkey’s latitude and reducing
                    the availability and productivity of agricultural land.

        <p> Rivers
            Eight main drainage basins may be discerned, of which two cross the country’s frontiers and six are entirely
            within Turkish territory. The smallest, in the far east of the country, is that of the Aras River, which
            rises south of Erzurum and flows east for some 250 miles (400 km) to the frontier with Azerbaijan,
            eventually reaching the Caspian Sea. The bulk of eastern Turkey, however, is drained by the Euphrates
            (Fırat) and Tigris rivers, which flow south for some 780 miles (1,250 km) and 330 (530 km) miles,
            respectively, before entering Syria and then Iraq, where they converge to enter the Persian Gulf (see
            Tigris-Euphrates river system).</p>

        <p> Lakes
            Turkey has about 50 lakes with areas larger than four square miles and more than 200 smaller ones. By far
            the largest are Lakes Van (1,434 square miles [3,714 square km]) and Tuz (about 600 square miles [1,550
            square km]); the latter is very shallow, expanding and contracting with the seasons. Being centres of inland
            drainage, both are saline.</p>

        <p> Climate
            Overview
            Turkey’s varied climate—generally a dry semicontinental Mediterranean variant—is heavily influenced by the
            presence of the sea to the north, south, and west and by the mountains that cover much of the country. The
            sea and the mountains produce contrasts between the interior and the coastal fringes. Several areas have the
            winter rainfall maximum typical of the Mediterranean regime, and summer drought is widespread. However, the
            elevation of the country ensures that winters are often much colder than is common in Mediterranean
            climates, and there are significant contrasts between winter and summer temperatures.</p>
