                part of a mountainous region sometimes known as the Armenian Highland.

    <div class="Turkey-description">
        <p>Turkey is situated at the crossroads of the Balkans, Caucasus, Middle East, and eastern Mediterranean. It is
            among the larger countries of the region in terms of territory and population, and its land area is greater
            than that of any European state. Nearly all of the country is in Asia, comprising the oblong peninsula of
            Asia Minor—also known as Anatolia (Anadolu)—and, in the east, part of a mountainous region sometimes known
            as the Armenian Highland. The remainder—Turkish Thrace (Trakya)—lies in the extreme southeastern part of
            Europe, a tiny remnant of an empire that once extended over much of the Balkans.</p>

            <p>The country has a north-south extent that ranges from about 300 to 400 miles (480 to 640 km), and it
            stretches about 1,000 miles from west to east. Turkey is bounded on the north by the Black Sea, on the
            northeast by Georgia and Armenia, on the east by Azerbaijan and Iran, on the southeast by Iraq and Syria, on
            the southwest and west by the Mediterranean Sea and the Aegean Sea, and on the northwest by Greece and
            Bulgaria. The capital is Ankara, and its largest city and seaport is Istanbul.</p>

            <p> Of a total boundary length of some 4,000 miles (6,440 km), about three-fourths is maritime, including
            coastlines along the Black Sea, the Aegean, and the Mediterranean, as well as the narrows that link the
            Black and Aegean seas. These narrows—which include the Bosporus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles—are
            known collectively as the Turkish straits; Turkey’s control of the straits, the only outlet from the Black
            Sea, has been a major factor in its relations with other states. Most of the islands along the Aegean coast
            are Greek; only the islands of Gökçeada and Bozcaada remain in Turkish hands. The maritime boundary with
            Greece has been a source of dispute between the two countries on numerous occasions since World War II.</p>
